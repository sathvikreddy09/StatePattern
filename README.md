# StatePattern with Battery example
#State pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. <br />
State design pattern is used when an Object changes its behavior based on its internal state.<br />
In this program I have implemented state pattern using Car Battery example.<br />
With the help of Car remote device we can Start / Stop / Reset the battery <br />
